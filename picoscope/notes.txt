tracecapture
C application that monitors gpio pins 8-15. It waits for any change, then records up to TRACE_COUNT changes over one second.
The trace details are sent through uart0 in the format
Header       uint64  0x12345678
Trace count  uint32
Traces       Time    uint
             Value   unsigned char
Terminator   uint64  0x87654321




To Do:
Remove the sleep(0.1) from the uart receiver so the transmitter delay can be removed
