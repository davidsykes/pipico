C/C++ project to allow the pico to be connected to via wifi with the intention of allowing the wifi credentials to be supplied for attaching to a new network
Also includes tcp server and client functionality.
It got a bit heavy, and started to fail when both client and server codes was used, so a subset of functionality was split out into the IR folders
Functionality is being moved to ir/transmitter/cpp
